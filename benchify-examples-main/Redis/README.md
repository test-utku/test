# Mocks for Redis

This example illustrates how Benchify can be used to test code which uses Redis, by leveraging mocks.  We're actively building out mocks for a number of popular services such as Redis, GCP, AWS, Supabase, etc.  The code being tested here is fairly trivial and simply meant to illustrate that Benchify works on code which uses Redis.
