# Examples of Benchify in Action ü•∑üèº

This repository contains interesting examples of how customers use Benchify to analyze their code.  If you have an interesting use-case for us, or an example of Benchify in action you'd like to share, please let us know!

Note, these are just a small set of examples which we make public for customer conversations and investor meetings -- we have a very large corpus of private examples as well.  If you receive a bug report from us on your open-source repository, and would like us to share the corresponding analysis here, let us know and we will add it with either a minimum viable reproducible example or a git submodule based integration.
